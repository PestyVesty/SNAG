# Questions
Search_Space.py: in GraphNAS_SearchSpace, what does "number_of_heads" refer to?

# TODOs
### For coding
- [ ] finish class injectivesearchspace in searchspace.py, then in trainer.py finish the if case for it
- [x] Finish doing check point 3 (submodel_manager)
- [ ] Before implementing, compare PPI and Cora to see the difference between the dataset, then compare it to the molecule datasets
- [ ] implement the code for processing the molecular data
- [ ] understand the characteristic of each dataset and document them in the thesis
- [ ] along with the task above, check how we got the molecule dataset from previous project, seems like it's easier to get it from https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/datasets.html (search HIV)

### For coding (for later)
- [ ] Look at other models such as agraph attention and add them into the search

### For reading
- [ ] Read Qing Wangs paper
- [ ] Read GNN papers
- [ ] 
### For writing
- [ ] GNN
- [ ] GCN
- [ ] Used dataset description 

### README file update
- [ ] Update commands for "injective" search space
- [ ]
